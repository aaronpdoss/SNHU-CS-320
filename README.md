# SNHU-CS-320

I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by testing my code via different software testing techniques. For this course we used JUnit tests to do this. In order to interpret the users needs we can conduct interviews, run trial phases of the program, and survey the target user base. Once that information is gathered we can determine how to best implement the users needs into the software in question. I approach software from the perspective of caution. I take measures to ensure that I am programming effectively and efficiently to provide the best possible program once I am finished.
